# C++ Programming & Data Structures Portfolio

Welcome to my collection of second-year university assignments. These projects focus on solving real-world logistical problems using advanced C++ data structures and Explainable AI (XAI) practices.

## 📂 Projects in this Repository

### 🛰 [Smart City Route Management System](./Smart_City_Route_Management_System)
A graph-based application that optimizes urban transport routes using Dijkstra's algorithm and transparent decision-making (XAI).

### 🚌 [Public Transport Queue System](./Public_Transport_Queue_System)
A simulation of a minibus taxi rank using Linear Data Structures (Queues and Stacks) to manage passenger flow and boarding times.

### 🇿🇦 [Transport Connectivity in Southern Africa](./C++_Practical_Project_Transport_Connectivity)
A graph-based model of regional road networks across Southern Africa, featuring BFS reachability and distance calculations.
